<p align ="left">Overview</p>

This was a final project for Statistics and Data Analysis 230 during the summer of 2021. My group including Zach Brown, Aidan Gannon, and I were given the autonomy to choose a data set and explore it using the techniques that we learned from class. We ended up choosing the world bank data set to predict a variety of factors such as happiness, life expectancy, and co2 concentrations. We utilized a variety of statistical analysis methods such as bootstrapping, permutations, two way tests, and more.
